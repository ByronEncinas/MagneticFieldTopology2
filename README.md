# Feature/Update

- [ ] Do simulations with rloc_boundary << 1 and make 10^3 N/cm3 the lower bound for the gas density
- [ ] Find Rise per log(V/per cell) to see if the resolution of the magnetic field (if the magnetic field varies too much from cell )
- [ ] Evaluate other high density regions in the 430 snapshots (discuss if looking at later times in CAS is useful)
